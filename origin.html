  <h2>Noughts and Crosses: Tic Tac Toe</h2>

    <h3>noun // tik-tak-to</h3>

<p>The game itself is thought to date to the Roman Empire. The 3 by 3 grid of a game called Terni Lapilli has been found scratched into surfaces. But because no markings have ever been discovered within the grid, evidence suggests the game might have been played with pieces placed on top.

The name tic tac toe comes from a game by the same name, no longer played, in which players with their eyes closed tossed a pencil down onto a slate marked with numbers, and earned the score the number indicated--something like blind darts. The game dates to the mid- to late 1800s. "Ticktack," according to the Random House Dictionary of English language, is a repetitive sound made by repetitive tapping, knocking or clicking. Thus, "tic tac toe" is an imitation of the sound the pencil makes when hitting the slate.</p>

<p>The U.S. renaming of Noughts and crosses as Tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses) for the EDSAC computer became one of the first known video games. The computer player could play perfect games of Tic-tac-toe against a human opponent....<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe" id="wiki" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>
