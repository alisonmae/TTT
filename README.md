Tic Tac Toe: "noughts & crosses"

** Things I would like to have done, TO ADD list **
- Use Boostrap - Responsive
- Choose a Player function
- Animated header
- Better aesthetic - fluid nav bar, kerning on entire page, pretty board
- More pages
- Proper positioning
- Automatic reset

Issue/Thought log from building this game:

- Positioning, positioning, positioning: I still could not manage to the buttons on top of my canvas properly, even after reading over what felt like a hundred articles about positioning. I'm happy that it plays the game with me at all, but of course I would've been happier understanding why the code really worked and then be able to position and size it properly. Positioning in general is still tough for me.

- Link / script best practices: "Bootstrap Errors"
I definitely need practice here. I decided after working with a different tic tac toe index that I wanted to start over - and not utilize Bootstrap this time. But then after finally getting the main board to look halfway decent, I started to build the things I was most comfortable with i.e. the title/nav bar etc, etc. I realized I really wanted it to be responsive, and yet when I incorporated Bootstrap, it screwed up the total overall appearance. I hope to take some more time reading about why this happens and how to troubleshoot something like that, although I'm sure best practice is to just utilize Bootstrap in the first place. I could have just used media queries but I did not spend enough time focusing on this here.

- IDs vs Classes: Parent and Child: Understanding the best way to write my CSS is most definitely a work in progress. I absolutely need to go and read/practice writing with mutliple classes and ids so I can really understand the difference between ".main #Logo" and "#Logo .main". Pretty simple, I know I have it in my notes somewhere where I can read up on it. Not keeping it DRY.

- DRY: Referenced above; I am unfortunately not keeping my code / CSS DRY; I'm very aware. I have lots of repeats - I'm sure as I write more analytically I will eventually get cleaner and cleaner with my code.

- Btns: I had to pull the buttons from Google; when I tried aligning buttons from scratch I had the worst time with positioning and sizing. The worst time. I still never managed to get it to work for me. I also found a couple different "aa" to "cc" js systems online because when I tried using numbers or percentages I just got confused in JS. I feel like finding this code was helpful but also detrimental to the learning of actually writing out the labels and implementing them into already written functions...I did use two different codebits but I feel like I ended up only using my reset btn code and if statements for the start and end of the game for writing it purely from my brain. I am able to read and understand the code that I implemented, but again, I just wish I had written it in the first place all on my own.

Things I still do not understand:

- Positioning
- Proper way to use divs and containers / nesting html
- Clearfix
- Git repositories and the best practice for creating one. Followed the steps multiple times and still had issues.

Things I feel I learned more about and am getting much more comfortable with:

- If statements and how to nest them/use them
- Creating buttons just using Javascript
- Writing notes in files, reference workflow
- Canceling out code quickly w 'CMD /' --* keyboard shortcuts *--
- camelCase - oMove and xMove really confused me when I was editing my code. Maybe that's silly, but camelCase took me awhile to get used to! :P
- CSS

Things I want to practice more, for my aesthetic that I figured out during this project:
- Nav bars
- Animations in CSS / JS
- Full screen websites
